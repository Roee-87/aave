This code simulates a user depositing an amount of Dai into a smart contract (vaultDai), which then deposits that Dai into Aave. The code then executes a withdrawl of Dai back to the smart contract, and then returns that Dai back to the original user.

# Deploying funds to Aave using forked Optimism mainnet

Step 1: Add a new network to Metamask called Optimism-Hardhat-Fork and manually configure the following settings:
RPC-URL: http://127.0.0.1:8545/  
 ChainID: 10

Step 2: Configure your hardhat.config.js file to enable hardhat to fork a mainnet. I'm using an alchemy RPC-URL to fork Optimism

    hardhat: {
      forking: {
        enabled: true,
        url: "https://opt-mainnet.g.alchemy.com/v2/<YOUR RPC API KEY FOR OPTIMISM HERE>",
      },
      chainId: 10,
    }

Step 3: Spin up the local node using hh node --network localhost. Import a test account into Metamask

Step 3: Use uniswap front end to load up on the tokens that you need. Hardhat provides you with 10,000 testEth.

Step 5: hh run scripts/deployDai.js --netowrk localhost
This deploys the contract and run the script
